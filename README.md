**What is Lax?** Lax (PAWN/LAX) or BLax (Batch Lax) is a simple compilation tool created using only batch scripts and various perfect combinations of the Pawn Code Compiler (PAWNCC). Initially, Lax was just a compiler tool, but Laterium Contrib. (Contributors) is now focused on developing Lax into a versatile tool for both the Pawn Language Compiler and SA-MP Server Integration.
